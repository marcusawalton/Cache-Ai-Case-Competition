# Cache-AI: The CacheAI Advantage

This project is part of the Cache-AI Case Competition, where the goal is to build AI-driven solutions to optimize athlete evaluations and marketability.

## Overview

Our model, **CacheAI**, focuses on refining metrics and dashboards to provide a more accurate, unbiased system for evaluating athletes and coaches. By leveraging new data points like risk/health, peer index, and coaching influence, CacheAI aims to revolutionize sports recruitment and performance analysis.

## Key Features

- **Risk + Health Metrics**: Implemented to measure athlete physical health and marketability risk based on legal history, injury history, and social behaviors.
- **Peer Index**: Integrates first-party data from athletes and coaches to rate athletes based on sideline behaviors, leadership, and coachability.
- **CacheValueâ„¢ Enhancements**: Refined to better reflect athlete impact by factoring in weighted positions, dynamic prospect rankings, and award bonuses.
- **Coaches Cache Score**: Introduced to evaluate coaches based on performance metrics like win/loss ratio, years of coaching, and player draft success.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Updated user interface with color-coded Cache Scores, history tracking, and score progression to improve the user experience.
